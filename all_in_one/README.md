This is a rollup of 3 bits of HW. It is based on the excellent work by Teapot labs's project bwlr1e

The Teapot Labs design is very good but I wanted a few changes:

1) External battery. Two methods to connect.
2) External solar panel. Two methods to connect.
3) LIS3MDL magnetometer vs BME688 for my sensing needs.
4) Use external antenna vs board antenna
5) CDS light sensor input
6) Dupont headers for external parts vs quic connects.
7) Sized to fit on my hot plate.
